# Open Weather Map API demonstration 

This project is a simple use case of the Open Weather Map API. It gives access to the current weather of a static list of cities and allow a sort by temperature of these cities.

# Notes

The API used is neighter RESTFull nor consistant and it may oblige to do some workarounds.

# TODO

For an improved version, Unit test and a multiview management would be necessary.
